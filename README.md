## ðŸ”§ **Project Overview**

This is our first prototype as instructed by the project guidelines for our capstone. In our final capstone project, we will use this as a base and implement even more functionality to the app. Planned features include:
- Allowing users to choose specific recipes for their personalized meal plans.
- Automatically generating meal plans based on tags and user preferences like dietary restrictions, calorie goals, or favorite ingredients.
- Adding an innovative "Fridge Scanner" feature where users can scan the contents of their fridge to generate recipes using available ingredients.

This prototype lays the foundation for our vision, with dynamic data fetching and an intuitive UI already in place. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance the app! ðŸš€
